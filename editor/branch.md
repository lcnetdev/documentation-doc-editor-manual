# Branch Mode


Branch mode is an advanced feature that allows you to edit and preview a parallel version of a manual that you intend to replace the original with.

Example use case:
- You have an existing manual you would like to refactor. 
- You click the Branch which will show you this dialog:
![create branch screenshot](../images/image-1771618002337.png)
- You name the branch something like "refactor" and click [Create Branch]
- The toolbar will now show you have switched to the Branch you just created:
![toolbar change to branch mode](../images/image-1771618327084.png)
- If you logged out and looked at the manuals available you will see your new branch:
![manual available listing](../images/image-1771618304652.png)
- And even on Github you would see the new branch:

- The urls also change to add the name of the Branch.
- You make your changes in the Branch which will be independent of the original manual. Nothing you do in the branch will show up in the original manual in View or Edit mode.
- When you are ready you can MERGE the the branch back into the original manual. This will **overwrite the original** (it will give you plenty of warnings)
